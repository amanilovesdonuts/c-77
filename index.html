        <h1>Project On Console</h1>
        <p>
            I made this app by using "Visual Studio Code." To get started,
            you need to open ,Visual Studio Code, and create a new folder.
            Open the folder you would like to use and start by making an "index.html,"
            "style.css," and a "main.js." Then, you can start coding!
        </p>
        A console screen is used to appply different texts on the screen
        as a beginer and learn the basics of how to. You print things on console
        by using the "console.log()" tag. To open a console
        screen, you would need to GO LIVE, and right click to inspect. You
        then would click console at the the top and there, you should find your 
        console.

        <script>
        var first_name="Amani";
        console.log(first_name);

        var last_name="Kiiru";
        console.log(last_name);

        var fullname=first_name.concat(last_name);
        console.log(fullname);

        var a= 10;
        var b= 5;
        var add= a + b ;
        console.log(add)
